Graphic Communications is an exciting and multifaceted industry. With coursework taught by industry experienced instructors, and hands-on application in our state-of-the-art computer lab using up to date software such as Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, students are fostered in a learning environment that empowers them to be strategic and creative thinkers. 

Students are exposed to a wide range of real-world client based work, both in the community, as well as in the school environment, to design and produce logos, brochures, posters, banners and decals. Students then print these products and apparel on traditional offset, digital, and screen presses. Students also have the opportunity to obtain co-op positions in the local community to gain experience and industry certifications.
