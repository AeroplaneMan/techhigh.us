Our goal is to prepare the students to succeed in the field of Information Technology. While the student progress through the program, they will have the opportunity to prepare for both A+, Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) and Microsoft certified Professional (MCP) certifications. More than 100 companies, educators, and industry executives worked to develop the A+ Certification program. A+ Certification means that a person possesses the knowledge and skills essential to become a successful computer science technician. This certification provides industry-recognized credentials, independent of specific product or vendor knowledge.

Students are also prepared for industry standard certifications, including Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA™), Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP™), and Network+. The Networking Academy program combines lectures and online learning with hands-on laboratory exercises in which students apply what they learn in class while working on actual networks.

The Microsoft IT Academy Program is a global IT learning solution that connects educators, students, and communities. The program reaches students during their early IT experience and continues throughout their professional careers. It is a life-long learning model of continuous improvement.

The VMware IT Academy Program is designed to introduce students to VMware technologies and equip them with VMware technical skills to compliment their chosen fields of study.

We arm our students with not only the technical skills that they need to survive in today’s ever advancing information age, but with the business and logic skills that they can carry with them for life.
