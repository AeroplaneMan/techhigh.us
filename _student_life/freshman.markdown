<h1 align="center">Freshmen Jumpstart</h1>

<p align="center">Our Jumpstart program is designed to help orient new students into our school! This is a great opportunity to meet your new teachers and classmates, navigate the building, and learn about our 23 technical areas.</p>

| Leading up to choosing a trade area, Freshman students will have the opportunity to experience eight different trade areas throughout a sixteen week period. |This is our alternating academic and technical area schedule! If a student started the school year in shop week, they are in the “Z week” group. If a student started the school year in academic week, they are in the “A week” group. For Z week students, their academic weeks fall on Z week and their shop weeks fall on A week. For A week students, their academic weeks fall on A week and their shop weeks fall on Z week. It can be confusing at first, but as the year goes on you’ll get the hang of it! | This is the classroom portion of our trade areas that are taken everyday during a students’ academic week. Students will learn key concepts to help them master their trades further and will provide students with a much deeper and well balanced understanding of their trade areas. | Students will receive their trade areas once the 16 week exploratory program is over and administration has finished sorting all the students into the shops based on the students’ final trade areas rankings. This is usually around the months of January and February. |
