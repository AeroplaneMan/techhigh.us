Want to be on the cutting edge of science? Environmental Science is a fast-growing field full of innovation that investigates environmental problems and how it impacts our world around us. Students perform hands-on activities that allow them to become skilled in marine/ wildlife biology, water systems, oceanography, sustainability practices and so much more. By the end of your four years, students will have the tools to be successful in any environmental science career, ranging from a marine biologist to an environmental engineer.
