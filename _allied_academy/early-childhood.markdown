Students who have a passion for working with children will gain a hands-on experience of Early Childhood Education. Our environment fosters an inclusive child-centered,  play based learning experience. Opportunities include working in our high quality laboratory Worcester Public School preschool interacting with young children. Students will use positive guidance skills and best practice while interacting with the children. Students will gain knowledge in child growth and development, planning, and implementing developmentally and ability appropriate activities to meet the needs of all learners. Upon graduation students will be eligible to receive teacher certification from the Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care. The credential will allow the student to teach in a private early childhood center.
