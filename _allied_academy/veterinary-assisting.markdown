Immerse yourself in a compassionate and innovative environment that fosters your love for animals in our Veterinary Assisting Program. Alongside leading instructors and staff from Tufts University, our students obtain real, hands-on experience working with animals at our on-site, Tufts at Tech Community Veterinary Clinic. Students also gain knowledge and experience working with large animal species through our partnerships with Green Hill Park and other area farms. They also learn about exotic and wildlife species, and care for our small classroom mammals, reptiles, and fish. With our well structured curriculum and our NAVTA approved Veterinary Assisting Program, our students are prepared for success with their Veterinary Assistant Exam their senior year.
