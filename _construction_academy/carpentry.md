The mission of the Carpentry course is to provide a safe and reliable work environment for the exploration and study of wood-related materials and the tools and techniques used to measure, cut, and fasten those materials. Practical experiences along with related construction and engineering theory develop studentâ€™s knowledge in the house carpentry field. Academic skills are integrated into the program curriculum to bring forward relevance and create a well rounded student.

The Carpentry Shop completes a multitude of community projects and builds brand new houses for individuals that would otherwise be unable to afford such structures. Local government and non-profit organizations benefit from the hard work of our students.
